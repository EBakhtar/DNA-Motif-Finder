# DNA-Motif-Finder
DNA Motif finder code completed for the UC SAN DIEGO Biology meets programming course. This code searches a DNA base sequence of the four base pairs (e.g. "ACGAGTCAGT"), and searches for 'motifs', short sequences which are seen multiple times within the code. These are biologically significant pieces of code. Motifs often differ from each other at one or multiple points within the code due to random mutation, and thus the motif finder must account for that. The code uses pseudocounts to apply Laplaces law of succession to avoid leaving out low probability matches, and Gibbs sampling to account for small changes which could occur in mutation.
